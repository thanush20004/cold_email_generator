   - Professional opening: "I hope this message finds you well"
   - Warm, friendly, and genuine tone
   - No sales-like or aggressive language
   - Matching the exact style of your reference email

2. **Email Structure**
   - Subject: Introduction - [Role] at Your Company
   - Professional greeting
   - Introduction of background and skills
   - Alignment with company needs
   - Soft CTA for connection
   - Professional closing with "Yours sincerely"

3. **Removed**
   - Aggressive marketing language
   - Quantified achievement bullet points
   - False urgency tactics
   - Sales-like CTAs
   - Overly formal/stiff language

4. **Added**
   - Genuine interest in company initiatives
   - Brief mention of relevant experience
   - Soft call-to-action
   - Portfolio links section
   - Professional signature

**File Modified:** `app/chains.py`

The email now generates professional, networking-style cold emails that build genuine connections rather than using high-pressure sales tactics.
